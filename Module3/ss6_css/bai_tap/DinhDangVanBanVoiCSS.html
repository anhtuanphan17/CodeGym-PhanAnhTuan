<p class="indent"><span class="bold">Vietnam</span> (Vietnamese: Việt Nam, [vîət nāːm] (audio speaker iconlisten)), officially <span class="bold">the Socialist Republic of Vietnam
</span>,[n 3]
    is a country<span class="color_blue">in Southeast Asia</span> . Located at the eastern edge of mainland Southeast Asia, it covers 311,699 square kilometres.
    With a population of over 96 million, it is the world's fifteenth-most populous country. Vietnam borders <span class="color_blue">China</span> to the north, Laos and Cambodia
    to the west, and shares maritime borders with <span class="color_blue">Thailand </span>through the Gulf of Thailand, and the <span class="color_blue">Philippines, Indonesia</span>,
    and <span class="color_blue">Malaysia </span>through the South China Sea. Its capital is Hanoi and its largest city is Ho Chi Minh City.[n 4]</p>

<p class="indent">Vietnam was inhabited as early as the Paleolithic age. The first known Vietnamese nation during the first millennium BC
    centred on the Red River Delta, located in modern-day northern Vietnam. The Han dynasty annexed and put the Vietnamese under Chinese rule
    from 111 BC, until the first independent dynasty emerged in 939. Successive monarchical dynasties absorbed Chinese influences
    through Confucianism and Buddhism, and expanded southward to the Mekong Delta. The Nguyễn—the last imperial dynasty—fell to French colonisation
    in 1887. Following the August Revolution, the nationalist Viet Minh under the leadership of communist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh
    proclaimed independence from France in 1945.</p>

<p class="indent">Vietnam went through prolonged warfare through the 20th century. After World War II, France returned to reclaim colonial power in the First Indochina
    War, from which Vietnam emerged victorious in 1954. The Vietnam War began shortly after, during which the nation was divided into communist
    North supported by the Soviet Union and China, and anti-communist South supported by the United States.
    Upon North Vietnamese victory in 1975, Vietnam reunified as a unitary socialist state under the Communist Party of Vietnam in 1976.
    An ineffective planned economy, trade embargo by the West, and wars with Cambodia and China crippled the country. In 1986,
    the Communist Party initiated economic and political reforms, transforming the country to a market-oriented economy.</p>

<p class="indent">The reforms facilitated Vietnamese integration into global economy and politics. A developing country with a lower-middle-income economy,
    Vietnam is one of the fastest growing economies of the 21st century. It is part of international and intergovernmental institutions including
    the United Nations, the ASEAN, the APEC, the CPTPP, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie,
    and the World Trade Organization. It has assumed a seat on the United Nations Security Council twice.
    Contemporary issues in Vietnam include corruption and a poor human rights record.</p>
